Nonlinear/Sediment/sed_flocs.F
- Fairly major revision (17/12/2020) including:
-- Minor changes: corrected alignment, commented-out CAUTION messages (too numerous), zw->z_w
-- 'dttemp .le. dt(ng)' -> 'dttemp .lt. dt(ng)', removing need for 'IF (dttemp.eq.dt(ng)) exit'
-- Option under new cpp SED_REDIST_FIRST to redistribute negative sediment concentrations prior to evaluating
nonnegativity (by calling flocmod_mass_control), thus reducing likelihood of needing to reduce time step.
-- Revised time step adaptation so that we do not recompute the time step unnecessarily if the nonnegativity
criterion is met -- rather we double the step size for the *next* time step (f_dtnext).
-- Added minimum step size parameter f_dtmin as hard-coded fraction of dt (f_dtmin_dt/8). This is to prevent
excessively small time steps, and may result in violations of mass conservation. 
-- Revised subroutine flocmod_mass_redistribute to include an option under new cpp SED_REDIST2 to
redistribute the negative mass in proportion to the existing *mass concentration* rather than number concentration.
This assumption may be safer when you have small size classes (~1 um) that contribute a lot to the total number 
concentration but little to the total mass concentration. It also avoids a potential division be zero in the
original approach (NNtmp).
We also added an option under new cpp SED_REDIST2_CAP to cap the mass concentrations at zero 
(after redistribution), thus potentially violating mass conservation but guaranteeing that the 
time step will not need to be reduced.
