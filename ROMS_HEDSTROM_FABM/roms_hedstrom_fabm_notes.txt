Modifications to Hedstrom ROMS source files (version April 2017 "v37_KATE")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Insertions and modifications can be browsed by searching "!!!" or "PWA" in each modified file in Src_v37_KATE_modify.


Nonlinear/albedo.F (NOT FABM RELATED):
- Modified albedo computations for consistency with CESM2/CICE5.1 (ALBEDO_CSIM)

Nonlinear/Biology/biology.F:
- added cpp-contingent include command for RFABM (17/11/2014)

Nonlinear/bulk_flux.F (NOT FABM-RELATED):
- new variable fsnow, modified correction of srflx to account for snow/ice albedo and also correct SRad (07/03/2019)
- modified correction of qswi for consistency with new cpp CCSM_ICE_SHORTWAVE (14/03/2019) 
  NOTE: In later versions of Hedstrom ROMS the lack of snow/ice albedo impact on srflx was corrected by
        updating srflx in ice_mk.h. However this is not done in the present version (ROMS_v37_KATE, April 2017),
        hence the impact of snow/ice albedo on srflx is missing in the present version (a major bug).
        Also, note that it may not be ideal to have the correction of srflx deferred to ice_mk.h. 
- Corrected intent(inout) to intent(in) for albedo, albedo_ice: these should not be modified in bulk_flux.F (05/11/2020)
- Deleted redundant SW_thru_ice assignment (05/22/2020)

Utility/cawdir_eval.F (NOT FABM-RELATED):

Base files for python-generated input files
-------------------------------------------

base_rfabm.in (from External/npzd_Franks.in)
- Copied and renamed ROMS/External/npzd_Franks.in

base_rfabm_inp.h (from Nonlinear/Biology/npzd_Franks_inp.h)
- Removed BioIter and wPhy parameters, but still need to input tracer diffusivities etc. (28/07/2015)
- Migrated to new version based on ROMS_v37_KATE/ROMS/Nonlinear/Biology/npzd_Franks_inp.h (09/03/2017)
- Added icheckmax and dBdt1max as runtime input parameters (in rfabm.in) (09/03/2017)
